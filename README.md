Astrometry deals with position and motion of heavenly bodies. Astrometry is a tool used to calibrate astronomical images by matching the star patterns in the image with known patterns in a standard database.

Here, we have used services of https://nova.astrometry.net to calibrate our images. We have two python files for this purpose. The nova.py is the main code file authored by me, while client.py is an API client code file obtained from https://nova.astrometry.net. However, I have made slight changes to the original API client code. The original file can be found here:  https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net/blob/master/net/client/client.py.
